 <hr>
 <h3>The Matrix</h3>
 <p>From it's genre-defining action sequences to it's strange yet familiar storyline, this movie has everything.</p>
 <h3>V for Vendetta</h3>
 <p>While a comic book movie, this story remains relavent no matter the decade.</p>
 <h3>Ferris Bueller's Day Off</h3>
 <p>As comedies go, this is by far my favorite.</p>
